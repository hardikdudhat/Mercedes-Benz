# Mercedes-Benz-Greener-Manufacturing

DESCRIPTION

Reduce the amount of time a Mercedes-Benz spends on the test track.

Problem Statement:

The company's engineers have developed a robust testing system to ensure the safety and reliability of each unique car configuration before it hits the road. As one of the world's largest premium car manufacturers, Mercedes-Benz prioritises safety and efficiency on its production lines. However, without a powerful algorithmic approach, optimising the speed of their testing system for many possible feature combinations is complex and time-consuming.

You must shorten the time cars spend on the test bench. Others will use a dataset that represents various permutations of features in a Mercedes-Benz vehicle to predict how long it will take to pass testing. Optimal algorithms will contribute to faster testing, which will result in lower carbon dioxide emissions while maintaining Mercedes-Benz's standards.

The following steps should be taken:

- If the variance for any column(s) is zero, those variables must be removed.
- Check for null and unique values for test and train sets.
- Apply label encoder.
- Perform dimensionality reduction.
- Predict your test_df values using XGBoost.
